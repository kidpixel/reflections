When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When wouldn't I?  I don't trust my computer or any computer.  I'm just a reboot away from total hardware failure as far as I'm concerned.  Keeping things local is like leaving your front door open in a bad neighborhood.  You're just asking to lose everything inside.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This sounds like it could be conflict hell if changes were always being done automatically.  Much like when you chose to do commits yourself with one logical change at a time and not having them done automatically, the concept behind pulls feels the same.
